### INDEXES
To access directly to the requested data = book's table of content: word ←→ page
No need to browse all the pages to find a word

Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a corresponding data record in a DBMS. 
### INDEX TYPES

* PRIMARY   unique, one per table
* UNIQUE    unique, no two rows have the same combination of the values
* INDEX     may not be unique, but improves lookup efficiency
* FULLTEXT  Create an index for each word in that column for full text search

PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, INDEX, and FULLTEXT are stored in B+trees
spatial data types use R-trees;
