### GRAPH DATABASES
For highly connected datasets (social graphs, recommendations)
Store nodes: links, attributs
Requests: distance, paths, recommandations
AWS Neptune


These databases are used to store data whose relations are best represented in a graph. Data is saved in graph structures with nodes (entities), properties (information about the entities), and lines (connections between the entities).
Examples of graph databases include Neo4J and InfiniteGraph.

**Applications**
Social networks (recommendation, shortest path, cluster ...)
GIS networks (roads, electricity network, freight ...)
Social web (Linked Data).

Neo4j : eBay, Cisco, UBS, HP, TomTom, The National Geographic Society
OrientDB (Apache) : Comcast, Warner Music Group, Cisco, Sky, United Nations, VErisign
FlockDB (Twitter) : Twitter


### GRAPH MODEL (Graph Base)

	From the "Graph Theory"
	Data are nodes with a document structure (see above)
	Arcs oriented and named links the nodes

Typically used in social networking applications: allow developers to focus more on relations between objects rather than on the objects themselves. 

A graph base database uses edges and nodes to represent and store data. These nodes are organized by some relationships with one another, which is represented by edges between the nodes. Both the nodes and the relationships have some defined properties.

A graph structure (a set of objects connected by links) comprising edges ans nodes
The interconnected objects are represented by mathematical abstractions, called vertices, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges. A set of vertices and the edges that connect them is said to be a graph.

Point = sommet = vertex. (vertices if ++)

nodes are organized by some relationships with one another, which is represented by edges between the nodes. Both the nodes and the relationships have some defined properties.
