## GENETIC ALGORITHM

Genetic Algorithms imitate theory of evolution and natural selection. 
Genetic Algorithm is a randomized search algorithm: it incorporates some kind of randomness or probability in its methodology

early 1990s: John Holland, the inventor of the genetic algorithm.

an algorithm for evolving programs to solve specific well-defined problems.

It is a type of automatic programming intended for challenging problems where the task is well defined and solutions can be checked easily at a low cost, although the search space of possible solutions is vast, and there is little intuition as to the best way to solve the problem.

This often includes open problems such as controller design, circuit design, as well as predictive modeling tasks such as feature selection, classification, and regression.

Genetic programming may be more powerful than neural networks and other machine learning techniques, able to solve problems in a wider range of disciplines.

1. Genetic programming now routinely delivers high-return human-competitive machine intelligence.
2. Genetic programming is an automated invention machine.
3. Genetic programming can automatically create a general solution to a problem in the form of a parameterized topology.
4. Genetic programming has delivered a progression of qualitatively more substantial results in synchrony with five approximately order-of-magnitude increases in the expenditure of computer time.
