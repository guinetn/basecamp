## FERMIONS

All of the matter (every particle) consists of just three fermions: two quarks and an [electron](http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/welect.html)

Fermions obey to Pauli exclusion principle: can't put 2 fermions on top of each other in space

### PROTONS
    "premier"

### NEUTRONS

### ELECTRONS

### QUARKS

>Six types of [quarks](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/quark.html) in the Standard Model in order of increasing mass:
- UP
- DOWN
- STRANGE
- CHARM
- BOTTOM
- TOP

Only the two lightest (up and down) are used to make protons and neutrons  
Put some [protons and neutrons](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/proton.html) together with some electrons and you have atoms.  
Put some atoms together and you have matter.
