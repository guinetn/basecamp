- [Std model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unl1jXFnzgo)

Written in a language called 'quantum field theory'
- Matter is not made of particules but of fields
- Interactions between the fields produce the physical world in the form of particles 

12 matter particles interacting with 3 forces and a higgs field

Explain the properties of most of the particles except hypothetical graviton, tought to carry force of gravity.  
General relativity is incompatible with aspects of the standard model
Stringtherory try to unite gravity with particule physics

The standard model describes something or the way something behaves:  
***Theoretical physics*** = equations, relation between some properties we think that thing will obey.
Simplicity and symmetry of these equations.

The ultimate goal of theoretical physics would be a [“Theory of Everything”](http://www.firstscience.com/SITE/articles/kaku.asp) or a “Grand Unified Theory” but gravity doesn’t behave in a way that would fit such a theory.
 
For everything in the entire universe besides gravity, we have the “Standard Model of Particle Physics”, which describes every particle we know about and how these particles interact together via the remaining forces:
- Electromagnetism (responsible for light, electricity, magnets)
- Strong nuclear force (responsible for holding everything together)
- Weak nuclear force (responsible for radioactivity)

**STANDARD MODEL BASIC MATTER BUILDING BLOCKS**

Every particle is either a fermion (matter particle) or a boson (force particle)

### next option?

“Beyond the Standard Model” physics covers options such as 
- supersymmetry
in which there are copies of all the particles but where fermions and bosons are swapped
- string theory
an attempt to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity.

These go some way towards rectifying some issues that the Standard Model faces, but, at present, tend to introduce further inconsistencies.
