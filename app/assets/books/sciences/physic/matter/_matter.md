Particles are excitations in quantum fields

Fundamental particles (no internal structure)
    * leptons
    * quarks

Composite particles 
    (have internal structure) called hadrons
    made of quarks, antiquarks, or both, bound by gluons (strong force)
    * Baryons
    * Mesons

Anti-particules  

    Most particles have an antimatter equivalent that has the same mass
    but charge and other properties are opposite
    - positron: antielectron, charge +1
    - anti-up quarks, charge -2/3
    - anti-down quarks, charge -1/3
    - antineutrino
    - antiproton: 2 anti-up, 1 anti-down, charge -1
    - antineutron: 1 anti-up, 2 anti-down, charge 0

Exotic-particules
    hypothesized, don't have a place in this classification
    Magnetic monopoles
    WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles)

Particles are divided into 

    Fermions: building block of matter
        wich form matter:
            BARYONS
                large-mass particules containing 3 quarks
                - proton  2u 1d charge +1
                - neutron 1u 2d charge  0

                protons + neutrons together = nucleus
                nucleus + electron = atom

            QUARKS
                feel the strong nuclear force
                6 "flavours" exists, only 2 are stable in ordinary matter:
                    - up
                        Its heavier version
                        - charm
                        - top      x350 000 electron mass
                    - down
                        Its heavier version
                        - strange
                        - bottom
                    Each can exist in any of 3 "colours"

               
            LEPTONS
                don't feel the strong nuclear force
                6 exists, only 2 are stable in ordinary matter:
                    
                    - electron, charge -1
                        Its heavier version (behave like an electron but are heavier)
                            - muon, x200 electron mass
                            - tau, x3500 electron mass
                    
                    - neutrino, charge 0, hard to detect
                        very light
                        barely interact with anything else (100 trillion passes across you in 1 sec)
                        origin: sun (most), some have been streaming through the universe since few sec after the big bang
                        Its heavier version
                            - muon neutrino
                            - tau neutrino

    In everyday life some particle are not stable:
        - 2nd generation: muon, charm, strange
        - 3rd generation: taux, top, bottom
    they decay to the first generation of particles: electron, up, down

    Particles come in a set of four: quarks ↑↓, electron, neutrino 
    Mathematical consistency condition: can't have one particle without the other three
    Why 3 generations is a mystery

    Dirac equation describe particles
$$(i\gamma^\mu + \partial{g}_\mu - m) \psi = 0$$

    Bosons: force-carrier particles
        
        allow particles to interacting through the 3 fundamentals forces: electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, (gravity)
        named after Indian Physicist Satyendra Nath Bose
        fermions are constantly swapping bosons between them affecting their motion and rising a 'force'

        gauge bosons: 
            - gluon: strong force
            - photon: electromagnetism
            - Z, W Boson: weak force
            - graviton ? tought to carry force of gravity
            - W+ intermediate vector boson
            - Higgs boson
            - X-Boson ?

        mesons
            particules made of 1 quark + 1 antiquark
            - pion: 1u + 1 anti-down  charge +1

## STATES OF MATTER

Differ in the particles energy and freedom particles can move relative to another. In order of common in the universe
- Plasma (in stars): a so hot gaz that collisions knocks electrons out of atoms making it made of ions + electrons moving very energetically
- Gaz: very weakly bonds, greater freedom
- Liquid: weak bound, move freely
- Solid: strong bound


A Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) is often said to be a "fifth state of matter"
