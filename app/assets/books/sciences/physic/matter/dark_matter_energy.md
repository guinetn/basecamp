Dark matter and dark energy are not included in the standars model
Missing explanation for 95% of the universe energy

## DARK MATTER

Made up of additional particles that don't interact with light
Have perhaps their own forces and bosons messengeer
Dark matter = Universe matter - [stars, visible objects] mass = invisible mass

Evidence: galaxies move faster that can be explained by the gravity of visible matter - there must be further mass present.

MACHO?: massive compact halo objects
WIMPs?: exotic subatomic particles that scarcely intercat with ordinary mater.

## DARK ENERGY

Even if dark matter deduced from observations is included, universe density is not sufficient to statify theories of its evolution. A dark energy must conteract gravity and causes universe to expand faster.
