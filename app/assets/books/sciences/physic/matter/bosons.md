## BOSONS

Help other particles to “communicate”, and this communication is what we call a force.

When two electrons repel each other, they exchange photons – the particles responsible for light – and we call this exchange the electromagnetic force.
Because photons are massless, they can travel a long way from the particle that emitted them.
There are similar bosons that particles use to communicate the other forces – the exchange of heavy W and Z bosons is what we call the weak force (given that the W and Z are “heavy”, the range of the weak force is small), and the exchange of massless gluons is what we call the strong force.
It won’t help that the W bosons have an electric charge, so they also communicate with photons. Stranger still, the gluons have another charge called “colour” which means they can communicate with themselves.

Now construct matter with some fermions and some bosons. We just need to write an equation that describes everything written above in a simple, symmetrical way.

Just as we can calculate the path of a ball through the air with a few pieces of information, the parameters in the above equation ensure the dynamics of theoretical particles match what we see in the real world.

To theoretical physicists, the above equation is beautiful, elegant, compact, and exhibits lots of the symmetries we expect to see in nature. So what’s wrong with it?

It’s not that it has a lot of terms - it needs to describe how each of the particles interacts with all the others. It’s that it needs more information.

There’s a mathematician’s quote about having too many parameters in a model:

“With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk”.

The Standard Model has 19 parameters which we fit to experiments: most of the fermion masses, and factors that determine the way certain groups interact.

One set of parameters that the Standard Model doesn’t require is the mass of neutrinos (fermions) as it predicts they are massless.
Experimentally, this is not true and, moreover, the fact they can change type of neutrino (which they have been shown to do) isn’t allowed if they are massless.

[Neutrinos](http://theconversation.com/explainer-the-elusive-neutrino-431) have other properties, too, and one of these is the way that they behave, which we call “left-handed” and “right-handed”.
Experimentally, the W bosons only interact with left-handed neutrinos, while the Standard Model predicts this interaction should be symmetric – in other words, the poor right-handed neutrinos shouldn’t miss out.

Higgs boson has been identified, is responsible for explaining the masses of the heavy fermions and bosons.

There are also some features that physicists consider to be missing from the Standard Model (apart from gravity). The biggest of these is the lack of room for [dark matter](https://theconversation.com/topics/dark-matter) particles.
