# CUDA - Compute Unified Device Architecture

Parallel computing platform created by Nvidia, released in 2007. 
For general purpose processing using the CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit or GPU. 
CUDA also has the Nvidia Performance Primitives library that contains various functions for image, signal, and video processing.

GPU = "Nvidia" because there are both CUDA and CUDNN available on it. CUDA and CUDNN are accelerators for your deep learning models that work only on Nvidia GPUs. If you have any other GPU than Nvidia, you belong to another time…

Some other libraries and collections include GPU4Vision, OpenVIDIA for popular computer vision algorithms on CUDA, MinGPU which is a minimum GPU library for Computer Vision, etc. Developers can program in various languages like C, C++, Fortran, MATLAB, Python, etc. while using CUDA.
