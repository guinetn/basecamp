# JetBrains Rider

Built in Java, and as with all Java IDEs, it really likes RAM and lots of CPU cores

ReSharper: has grown to encompass unit testing, code coverage, performance and memory profiling, code reverse engineering...
Much of this is included in VS 2019  
Rider includes every ReSharper feature already built in to it
