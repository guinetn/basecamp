# SOLVE MECHANICAL PROBLEMS WITH LEGO

## Making Lego Car CLIMB Obstacles

1. Construct a Lego car
2. Improving it against obstacles until it becomes a capable climber
Consider
- wheel diameter
- gear ratio
- 4-wheel drive
- tire grip
- breakover angle
- weight distribution

* Base rules for all builds:
- 4 wheels
- no steering (to simplify the builds)
- only Lego parts used

* Remote control
