# package managers

pip packages are usually hosted on a PyPI. This can be a private or public repository for open-source or private Python packages. For those not familiar with the Python package repository, when you think of PyPI, think of RubyGems for Ruby, Packagist for PHP, Maven for Java, CPAN for Perl, and npm for Node.js.
