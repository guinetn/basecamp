## Newton's laws (principle of motion)

Foundation of classical mechanics
Newton’s laws are verified by experiments but they can not be demonstrated theoretically (mathematically).
All Newton’s laws of motion are defining the force from three different perspectives: the first law defines the impact of a force on a body (qualitative definition), the second law defines the value of the force (quantitative definition), and the third law states that a single isolated force can not exist.

### 1st law: inertia principle
An object keeps its state as long as there is no force which acts upon it. The state of the body can be either stationary or moving with constant speed.
An object with a mass will maintain its status quo, unless there is a force which will act on it.
 
### 2nd law: force’s action principle
F=m.a 
Resultant force F [N] acting on a body is product between the mass m [kg] and the body’s acceleration a [m/s²].

Force is defined as the change in time of the `momentum p [kgm/s]`:
p=m.v
F=dp/dt=d(m.v)/dt=m.dv/dt=m.a

### 3rd law: action and reaction principle
If a given body exerts a force on a second body, the second body will exert in the same time a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.

The three common classical mechanics approaches to solve problems
Ex: A ball is at ground level and tossed straight up with an initial velocity. The only force on the ball while it is in the air is the gravitational force.

## Newtonian

* we know the forces
* have a reasonable coordinate system

Newton’s Three Laws
F=ma
Sum(F) = 0
F21=F12

momentum: p=mv & F=dp/dt

That’s your equation of motion for a tossed ball: y = y0 + v0t - 1/2gt²

## Lagrangian

L = T - U

T Generalized kinetic energy
U Potential energy

## Hamiltonian

in quantum mechanics we use the Hamiltonian operator.
