# Changelog

A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.

***Why keep a changelog?***
To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.

***Who needs a changelog?***
People do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human beings who care about what's in the software. When the software changes, people want to know why and how.


## GUIDING PRINCIPLES
- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

## TYPES OF CHANGES
 
- Added for new features.
- Changed for changes in existing functionality.
- Deprecated for soon-to-be removed features.
- Removed for now removed features.
- Fixed for any bug fixes.
- Security in case of vulnerabilities.

## Tips

Keep an Unreleased section at the top to track upcoming changes.

This serves two purposes:
- People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
- At release time, you can move the Unreleased section changes into a new release version section.
