# Microsoft has decided to use Chocolatey´s framework with the upcoming OneGet client: https://github.com/OneGet/oneget
# It is a unified interface to package management systems and aims to make Software Discovery, Installation and Inventory (SDII) work via a common set of cmdlets (and eventually a set of APIs). Regardless of the installation technology underneath, users can use these common cmdlets to install/uninstall packages, add/remove/query package repositories, and query a system for the software installed.

# With OneGet, you can
# Manage a list of software repositories in which packages can be searched, acquired, and installed
# Search and filter your repositories to find the packages you need
# Seamlessly install and uninstall packages from one or more repositories with a single PowerShell command
