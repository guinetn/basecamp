 Time series data
 A time series is a series of data points indexed in time. Usually, a time series is a sequence taken at successive, equally spaced points in time: a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
