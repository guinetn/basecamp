# V

## VAR - Value-at-risk
A widely used risk measurement technique that calculates (at a pre-specified level of probability) the loss that would be experienced in a day or some other pre-specified time horizon in the event of an increase in volatility or an adverse correlated move in market prices, assets or the investments making up a portfolio. At Man, the proprietary measure of VAR is also known as Total Portfolio Risk (TPR).

## Volatility
Volatility is the measurement of risk used most often in the investment industry. It measures how variable price changes are in relation to the price trend for an investment. It is important to note that volatility says nothing about the direction of the trend itself. Expressed in slightly more technical terms, volatility is a measure of how much a set of returns for an investment deviates from the price trend or mean of that investment. It is usually calculated as 'standard deviation' [see Standard deviation] and expressed as 'annualised volatility' – the standard deviation on a yearly basis.
