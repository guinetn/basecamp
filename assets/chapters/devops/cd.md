# CD - CONTINUOUS DELIVERY AND CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT

## CONTINUOUS DELIVERY PROCESS
involves a mandatory time lag in the final release – a manual step of approving the initiation of a deploy to production.

## CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT PROCESS
Every change in the source code is deployed to production automatically, without explicit approval from a developer.
