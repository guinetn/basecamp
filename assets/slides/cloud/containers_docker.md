# Docker

https://www.docker.com/

 open-source orchestration tool which is used for the creation, packaging, and deployment of applications using containers. It allows you to package the application with all its libraries, dependencies, and other objects that is needed to run the application. It will allow you to deploy containers as needed to the production environment, development environment, or other environments that you might need.

Containerization software for automating the deployment and management of applications within an isolated environment. This software allows us to “pack” and ship an application, along with all of its needed files, libraries, and dependencies, into a “docker container“. That container can then be easily ported to any Linux system that contain cgroups support within the kernel, and provides a container management environment. Docker is one of several containerization implementations (not to be confused with virtualization) based on this cgroups mechanisms built into the Linux kernel.
